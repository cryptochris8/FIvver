```
FlowCraft Studio - AI Merchandise E-Commerce Store
```

**Project cost:** 1500

**Project started on:** 01 / 26

- Multiple payment integrations: Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, and credit cards
- Email subscription system for marketing campaigns
- Clean, minimalist design that reflects the AI/tech brand identity
- Mobile-responsive layout optimized for conversions
- Integrated analytics for tracking sales and visitor behavior

## Project 2: Declassified.io

**Project name:**
```
Declassified.io - Interactive Investigation Game
```

**Industry:** Entertainment

**Project duration:** 1-3 months

**Project cost:** 2500

**Project started on:** 11 / 25

**Project description:**
```
Declassified.io is an interactive investigation game platform I designed and developed from scratch. Players explore real declassified historical cases through branching narratives, quizzes, and achievement systems.

The Challenge:
The project required building an engaging, game-like experience entirely in the browser — no downloads, no plugins. The content covers sensitive historical events (JFK assassination, Pentagon UAP reports, Watergate) and needed to be fact-based and educational while still being fun to play. A privacy-first approach was essential: no tracking, no ads.

What I Built:
- Interactive investigation game engine with branching narrative system
- Multiple case files: JFK, Pentagon UAP reports, Watergate, and more
- Quiz system with scoring and progress tracking
- Achievement unlock system to reward exploration
- Clean, dark-themed UI designed for immersive reading
- Fully responsive — works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Privacy-first: zero tracking scripts, no ads, no data collection
- Mobile app version also in development

Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Netlify

The platform has received positive feedback for its unique blend of education and entertainment. Players appreciate the depth of research and the engaging presentation of real historical documents.

The Red Brick Road - Fantasy Novel Landing Page
```

**Industry:** Arts & Design

**Project cost:** 150

**Project started on:** 10 / 25

**Project description:**
```
The Red Brick Road is a promotional landing page I built for my published fantasy novel — a reimagining of the Land of Oz. The site needed to capture the book's whimsical tone while driving readers to purchase on Amazon and engage on Goodreads.

The Challenge:
As both the author and developer, I needed a site that balanced creative storytelling with clear calls-to-action. The design had to evoke the fantasy world of Oz while remaining fast, accessible, and conversion-focused.

- Free chapter preview section to hook potential readers
- Character profiles and location guides that expand the book's world

The site serves as the central marketing hub for the novel, connecting readers to purchase links, previews, and community engagement. It demonstrates how a well-designed landing page can support product launches on a budget.
