## Gig Description

**Got an idea that needs more than a website? I build custom web applications.**

From interactive dashboards to SaaS platforms, I develop full-stack web applications tailored to your exact requirements. I use React, Next.js, and Node.js to build fast, scalable apps that your users will love.

**What I build:**
- Interactive web applications
- Admin dashboards and data panels
- SaaS products and platforms
- User authentication and account systems
- API integrations and custom backends
- Real-time features and dynamic content
- Internal business tools and automation

**My tech stack:**
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, REST APIs
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase, Firebase
- **Auth:** JWT, OAuth, session-based authentication
- **Deployment:** Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Docker

**Proof of work:**
I built Declassified.io (declassifiedio.netlify.app) — an interactive investigation game with branching narratives, user progression, and dynamic content. See more projects at chriscampbell.dev.

**My process:**
1. Discovery call to understand your requirements
2. Technical planning and architecture design
3. Development in sprints with regular demos
4. Testing and quality assurance
5. Deployment and launch
6. Post-launch support and iteration

Let's turn your idea into reality — message me to discuss your project!

## Requirements (Ask the Buyer)

1. Describe your web application idea — what problem does it solve?
2. Who are the target users? How many users do you expect?
3. What features are must-haves for launch vs. nice-to-haves for later?
4. Do users need to create accounts and log in?
5. Will the app need to integrate with any external services (payment, email, APIs)?
6. Do you have wireframes, mockups, or a design in mind?
7. Do you have any existing backend, database, or API to integrate with?
8. What is your timeline and budget range?
9. Are there any similar apps you'd like to reference?

## FAQ

**Q: I have an idea but no technical plan — can you help?**
A: Absolutely. I'll work with you to define the scope, features, and technical approach during a discovery phase before we start building. This is included in all packages.

**Q: What's the difference between a website and a web application?**
A: A website primarily displays information (like a portfolio or business site). A web application has interactive functionality — user accounts, data processing, dashboards, forms that do things, etc. Think of the difference between a restaurant's website vs. a food ordering platform.

**Q: Will I own the code?**
A: Yes. You receive full source code and ownership upon delivery. I can also transfer the GitHub repository to your account.

**Q: Can the app scale as my user base grows?**
A: Yes. I build with scalability in mind — proper database design, efficient API architecture, and cloud-ready deployment. The Premium package includes performance optimization specifically for growth.

**Q: Do you offer ongoing development after launch?**
A: Yes! After the initial project, I offer ongoing development and maintenance. Many clients continue working with me to add features and improvements over time.

**Q: What if the project scope changes during development?**
A: I'm flexible. If requirements evolve, we'll discuss the impact on timeline and budget before making changes. Clear communication is key to a successful project.

**Q: Can you work with my existing tech stack?**
A: Potentially. My primary stack is React/Next.js with Node.js, but I'm adaptable. Message me with your requirements and I'll let you know if it's a good fit.
