- Interactive web applications
- Admin dashboards and data panels
- SaaS products and platforms
- User authentication and account systems
- API integrations and custom backends

- Internal business tools

My tech stack:
Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express, REST APIs
Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase, Firebase
Auth: JWT, OAuth, session-based
Deploy: Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Docker

Proof of work:

My process:
1. Discovery — understand your requirements
2. Planning — architecture and technical design
3. Development — sprints with regular demos

6. Support — post-launch iteration

Message me to discuss your project!
