## FAQ

**Q: What platform do you build on?**
A: I build with React and Next.js — a modern framework that produces fast, SEO-friendly websites. Unlike WordPress, there's no bloat, no plugins to update, and no security vulnerabilities from third-party code.

**Q: Can I update the website content myself?**
A: Yes! In the Premium package, I integrate a CMS so you can update text, images, and blog posts without touching code. For Basic/Standard, I provide the source code and can walk you through simple edits.

**Q: Will my website rank on Google?**
A: I build every site with SEO best practices — semantic HTML, proper meta tags, fast loading speeds, and mobile responsiveness. These are the foundation for search engine ranking. For advanced SEO strategy (keyword research, content marketing), I can recommend partners.

**Q: Do you offer website maintenance after delivery?**
A: Yes! I offer monthly maintenance packages for updates, bug fixes, and content changes. We can discuss this after your site launches.

**Q: Can you add features later (e-commerce, booking, etc.)?**
A: Absolutely. Because I build with a modern, scalable tech stack, adding features down the road is straightforward.

**Q: How do we communicate during the project?**
A: I provide regular updates through Fiverr messaging. For larger projects, I can share a progress link so you can preview the site as it's built.
