## Gig Description

**Ready to sell online? I'll build you an e-commerce store that drives sales.**

I create custom e-commerce websites and Shopify stores that look professional, load fast, and make it easy for your customers to buy. From product catalogs to payment integration, I handle the full build so you can focus on your business.

**What you get:**
- Fully functional online store
- Product catalog with categories and search
- Shopping cart and secure checkout
- Payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal, Shopify Payments)
- Mobile-responsive design that works on every device
- Inventory management setup
- Order notification system
- SEO optimization for product pages
- Source code or full Shopify store ownership

**I build on:**
- **Shopify** — Best for quick launch and easy management
- **Custom (React/Next.js)** — Best for unique designs and full control
- **Shopify + Custom Frontend** — Best of both worlds

**Proof of work:**
I built FlowCraft Studio (flow-craft-studio.myshopify.com), an AI-themed merchandise store on Shopify with custom collections, product pages, and full checkout flow.

## FAQ

**Q: Shopify or custom — which should I choose?**
A: **Shopify** is great if you want an easy-to-manage store with built-in hosting and support. **Custom (React/Next.js)** is better if you want a unique design, full control, and no monthly platform fees beyond hosting. I'll help you choose based on your needs.

**Q: Can I manage the store myself?**
A: Yes! Shopify stores have a built-in admin panel. For custom stores, I can integrate a headless CMS so you can add/edit products without code.

**Q: Do you handle product photos?**
A: I don't do product photography, but I'll optimize any images you provide for fast loading and consistent display across your store.

**Q: What about shipping?**
A: I can set up flat-rate shipping, free shipping thresholds, or integrate real-time shipping calculators depending on your package.

**Q: Can I add more products later?**
A: Absolutely. Both Shopify and custom stores are built to scale. You can add products anytime.

**Q: Do you set up the payment processing?**
A: Yes! I integrate Stripe, PayPal, Shopify Payments, or your preferred gateway. You'll need to create your own merchant account (I'll guide you through it).
